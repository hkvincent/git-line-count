# git-line-count
The script is used to count the lines of code per team member.

# how to use
you can run the script with just the member names, and it will use the default date range:

```bash
./team_stats.sh "John" "Vincent" "Joey" "Victor"
```

Or you can provide a custom date range:

```bash
./team_stats.sh "2023-02-01" "2023-03-01" "John" "Vincent" "Joey" "Victor"
```
